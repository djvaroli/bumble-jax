## The Name
Transformers are both alien robots and a model architecture (and other things). My favorite transformer was always Bumblebee so I decided to name this project accordingly. I explored other options, such as `optimusjx` and `jaximus-prime` but `bumblejax` proved itself to be the much more elegant candidate.
